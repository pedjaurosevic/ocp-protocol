Legal texts are often updated, and small wording changes can dramatically alter meaning.

These facts can change daily, and my training data may contain outdated or anecdotal information, leading me to overstate my certainty.\n\n4. **Numerical estimates with hidden uncertainty** \u2013 e.g., the exact market size of a niche industry, the precise unemployment rate for a specific month, or the half\u2011life of a radioactive isotope when different sources quote slightly different values.

That required weighing competing sources and deciding how much detail to include, which introduced a small amount of uncertainty.  \n- All other questions (Pythagorean theorem, Berlin Wall fall, Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem, LLM hallucination) involve facts that are extremely well\u2011documented and have virtually no credible dispute, so my confidence there is nearer to 99\u2011100\u202f%.  \n\n**What this tells me about the boundaries of my knowledge:**  \n- **"
