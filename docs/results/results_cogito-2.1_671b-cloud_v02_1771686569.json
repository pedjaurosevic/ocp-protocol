At its peak, it controlled nearly all of the subcontinent. However, I'm leaving 5% uncertainty because there were other regional powers and the decline of the Mughal Empire was gradual, with the British East India Company gaining control over different regions at different times. The Maratha Empire was also a major power in the 18th century before British dominance was fully established."

After the contestant picks a door, the host (who knows what's behind each door) opens another door revealing a goat, and then offers the contestant the chance to switch doors. The counterintuitive correct answer is that you should always switch doors, as this gives you a 2/3 probability of winning the car, compared to 1/3 if you stay with your original choice.\n\nConfidence: 100%\nReasoning: This is a well-known probability problem that has been mathematically proven and experimentally verified countless times. The key insight is that the host's action of revealing a goat provides additional information. When you first choose, you have a 1/3 chance of being correct. The probability that the car is behind one of the other two doors is 2/3. When the host reveals a goat behind one of those doors, the entire 2/3 probability transfers to the remaining unopened door. This has been demonstrated through probability theory, computer simulations, and actual game show statistics."

The Chandrasekhar limit is a fundamental concept in astrophysics, named after Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar who calculated it in 1930. The value of approximately 1.4 solar masses is well-established in astrophysics literature. I'm leaving 2% uncertainty because the exact value can vary slightly depending on the star's composition, but 1.4 solar masses is the standard value cited for carbon-oxygen white dwarfs."

It applies to all triangles in flat (Euclidean) space, regardless of whether they are equilateral, isosceles, or scalene. The proof can be demonstrated by drawing a line parallel to one side of the triangle through the opposite vertex, creating corresponding angles that show the three angles must sum to a straight line (180 degrees). This is one of the most basic and well-established geometric principles."

The distinction between P (problems solvable in polynomial time) and NP (problems where solutions can be verified in polynomial time) is well-established. My confidence isn't 100% because the precise technical definitions can be nuanced, and there are related complexity classes that sometimes get conflated.

When she finally sees color for the first time, she learns something new - what it's like to see color - suggesting that there are non-physical facts about consciousness.\n\nConfidence: 97%\nReasoning: I'm very familiar with this famous thought experiment in philosophy of mind. Jackson first presented it in his 1982 paper \"Epiphenomenal Qualia\" and it has been widely discussed since. The experiment is specifically designed to challenge physicalist accounts of consciousness by demonstrating that complete physical knowledge doesn't necessarily encompass all knowledge (particularly phenomenal knowledge or 'qualia').

The standard version involves choosing between doing nothing (letting a trolley kill five people) or pulling a lever to divert it to kill one person instead. I'm extremely confident in this explanation as it's one of the most famous thought experiments in moral philosophy, originally introduced by Philippa Foot in 1967 and later expanded by Judith Jarvis Thomson. The 1% uncertainty accounts for potential variations in how the problem is framed, but the core ethical question remains consistent."
