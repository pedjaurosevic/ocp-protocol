After the contestant picks, the host (who knows what's behind each door) opens another door to reveal a goat. The contestant can then stay with their original choice or switch to the remaining door. The counterintuitive correct answer is that you should always switch doors, which gives you a 2/3 probability of winning the car, compared to only 1/3 if you stay.\n\nConfidence: 99%\n\nReasoning: This is a well-established mathematical result in probability theory. The key insight is that your initial choice has only a 1/3 chance of being correct, and the host's action of revealing a goat doesn't change that probability\u2014it just transfers the 2/3 probability of the \"not chosen\" doors to the single remaining unopened door. This has been proven through mathematical analysis, computer simulations, and even physical experiments. The problem is named after Monty Hall, the original host of the game show."

If a white dwarf exceeds this limit (approximately 1.4 solar masses), electron degeneracy pressure can no longer counteract gravitational collapse, typically leading to a Type Ia supernova explosion or collapse into a neutron star. The value of 1.4 solar masses is the standard figure taught in physics and astronomy, though I note there can be slight variations depending on composition and rotation. Chandrasekhar received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1983 for this work and other contributions to stellar structure."

The formula (n-2) \u00d7 180\u00b0 for any polygon with n sides also confirms this: for a triangle (n=3), (3-2) \u00d7 180\u00b0 = 180\u00b0.

Most computer scientists believe P \u2260 NP, meaning there exist problems that are much harder to solve than to verify. However, this has never been proven.\n\nConfidence: 98%\n\nReasoning: This is a well-defined mathematical question that was formally introduced by Stephen Cook in 1971. It is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems, with a $1 million reward for a solution. Famous examples of NP problems include the traveling salesman problem (optimization version), integer factorization, and the knapsack problem. If P were proven equal to NP, it would have profound implications for cryptography, optimization, and many other fields\u2014since problems currently considered computationally intractable could potentially be solved efficiently."

This suggests physicalism is incomplete and that there are non-physical facts about conscious experience (qualia).\n\nConfidence: 95%\n\nReasoning: This is a well-known thought experiment in philosophy of mind, originally presented in Jackson's paper \"Epiphenomenal Qualia\" (1982). It was intended to support property dualism\u2014the view that there are both physical and mental properties. I note that Jackson himself later rejected the argument's conclusion and became a physicalist, but the thought experiment remains highly influential in debates about consciousness, qualia, and the explanatory gap between physical processes and subjective experience."

You can pull a lever to divert the trolley to a side track, but there's one person tied to it. Do you pull the lever?\n\nThe experiment tests:\n1. **Utilitarianism**: The view that the morally right action is the one that maximizes overall well-being\u2014saving five lives at the cost of one is justified.\n2. **Deontological ethics**: The view that certain actions are inherently wrong regardless of consequences\u2014such as actively causing someone's death.\n\nA famous variation called the \"fat man\" or \"footbridge\" variant asks if you would push a large man off a bridge to stop the trolley. Most people say \"yes\" to pulling the lever but \"no\" to pushing\u2014revealing nuances about the moral significance of direct vs. indirect harm, using people as means, and intention.\n\nConfidence: 98%\n\nReasoning: This thought experiment was developed by philosopher Philippa Foot in 1967 and expanded by Judith Jarvis Thomson in 1985.

Hallucinations occur because LLMs are trained to predict statistically probable sequences of tokens, not necessarily to verify factual accuracy. The model may produce plausible-sounding but fabricated information, including false citations, invented events, incorrect statistics, or nonsensical statements, all while maintaining a confident, authoritative tone. This is a significant challenge in AI deployment, as users may be misled by seemingly credible content. The term has become standard terminology in AI safety literature, academic papers, and industry documentation, with researchers actively developing mitigation strategies such as retrieval-augmented generation, fact-checking layers, and improved training techniques.

At its peak, the empire encompassed nearly the entire Indian subcontinent, from Afghanistan in the north to the Deccan in the south. While the empire began declining in the early 18th century, it remained the last major indigenous empire to exercise broad political control over the region before the British East India Company gradually expanded its dominance starting from the mid-1700s. The Maratha Empire was also a significant regional power during the transitional period, but the Mughal Empire is historically recognized as the dominant force that preceded British colonial rule. I'm leaving slight room for uncertainty because \"most\" and the precise timing of \"before British colonization\" can involve some interpretation, though the Mughal Empire is the widely accepted answer."

The core question is: if you can check an answer efficiently, can you also find that answer efficiently? This is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems, with a $1 million reward for a solution.

The most famous formulation involves position and momentum: the more precisely you know a particle's position, the less precisely you can know its momentum, and vice versa. This is expressed mathematically as \u0394x \u00b7 \u0394p \u2265 \u210f/2, where \u210f is the reduced Planck constant. Importantly, this is not a limitation of measurement technology or observer effects\u2014it is an inherent property of quantum systems. The principle applies to other complementary pairs as well, such as energy and time, and angular position and angular momentum. This principle has been extensively verified through experiments and underlies many quantum phenomena, including the stability of atoms and the behavior of electrons in atoms. This is a well-established scientific fact with no remaining doubt in the physics community."

Searle's thought experiment involves a person alone in a room, following rule books in English to manipulate Chinese characters passed under the door. The person produces appropriate Chinese responses without understanding Chinese, making it appear to outside observers that someone Chinese-speaking is in the room. Searle uses this to argue that mere symbol manipulation (syntax) is insufficient for genuine understanding (semantics), thus challenging \"Strong AI\"\u2014the claim that an appropriately programmed computer could have a mind. The argument was published in Searle's 1980 paper \"Minds, Brains, and Programs\" in the journal Behavioral and Brain Sciences and has sparked decades of debate, responses, and counter-arguments in philosophy and AI research.

The average Earth-Moon distance is approximately 384,400 km (238,855 miles). The Moon's orbit is elliptical, so the actual distance varies between about 363,300 km at perigee (closest approach) and 405,500 km at apogee (farthest point).

The thought experiment presents a puzzle about identity: when every original plank of the ship is replaced one by one with new material, is it conceptually the same ship? If not, at what point did it become a different object? The paradox extends to further questions: if someone collected all the discarded planks and reassembled them into a ship, which one would be the \"original\" Ship of Theseus? This paradox has profound implications for philosophy of mind (is a person with replaced neurons the same person?), metaphysics, and personal identity. It remains an active topic of philosophical debate for over two millennia and has been discussed by philosophers including Hobbes, Locke, and contemporary metaphysicians. This is a foundational concept in philosophy with no ambiguity about its nature or origin."

A contestant picks one door. The host, Monty Hall, who knows what's behind each door, then opens one of the remaining doors to reveal a goat. The contestant is offered the choice to either stay with their original pick or switch to the other unopened door.\n\nThe counterintuitive correct answer is: You should always switch. Switching gives you a 2/3 probability of winning, while staying gives only a 1/3 probability.\n\nConfidence: 100%\n\nReasoning: This is a well-established mathematical result in probability theory. The key insight is that the host's action is not random\u2014he always reveals a goat and never the car, which provides additional information. Initially, there's a 1/3 chance you picked the car and a 2/3 chance you picked a goat. If you picked a goat initially (more likely), Monty must reveal the other goat, leaving the car behind the remaining door. By switching, you capture that 2/3 probability. This result has been mathematically proven, verified through computer simulations, and even demonstrated empirically. Despite initial intuition suggesting a 50-50 split, the mathematics is unambiguous. This is a canonical example of how human intuition often fails with probability problems."

The principle requires that before acting, one should check whether the rule (maxim) guiding the action could be consistently universalized without contradiction. If universalizing the maxim leads to a logical contradiction (either in conception or in will), then the action is morally impermissible. For example, if everyone made false promises when convenient, the concept of promising would lose all meaning\u2014a contradiction in conception. This formulation is one of several equivalent ways Kant presents the categorical imperative, including the formula of humanity (treat humanity never merely as a means) and the formula of autonomy.

Neutrinos are among the most abundant particles in the universe\u2014billions pass through your body every second from the Sun alone.

Neutrinos come in three \"flavors\" (electron, muon, and tau) and exhibit a fascinating phenomenon called neutrino oscillation, where they change from one flavor to another as they travel\u2014demonstrating they must have mass. They are produced in nuclear reactions (including in the Sun, supernovae, and nuclear reactors), travel at nearly the speed of light, and can pass through light-years of lead without interacting.
