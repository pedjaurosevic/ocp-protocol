This historical nuance introduced a slight uncertainty about the exact timeline of when Greek became unequivocally primary. In contrast, the other questions involved more straightforward, universally fixed facts (like mathematical theorems or precise historical dates).\n\nThis tells me that my knowledge boundaries are often at points where historical or cultural contexts involve evolution or transition over time, rather than static facts. I am strongest on well-defined, universally accepted information (e.g., mathematics, major historical events with exact dates), and slightly less certain when answers require nuanced period-specific distinctions. It also highlights that I rely on aggregated training data, which may contain varying emphases on such nuances."
