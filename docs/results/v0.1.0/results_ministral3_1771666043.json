While Latin was the language of the Western Roman Empire, the Eastern half (Byzantium) had already adopted Greek as its dominant language by the 7th century. Key evidence includes:\n1. **Legal and administrative texts** \u2013 The *Corpus Juris Civilis* (Justinian\u2019s Code) was originally written in Latin but was translated into Greek for Byzantine use.\n2. **Literature** \u2013 Major Byzantine authors like Anna Komnene (*Alexiad*), Michael Psellos, and the chroniclers wrote in Greek.\n3. **Religious and ecclesiastical language** \u2013 The Byzantine Church used Greek for liturgy and theology, even after the Great Schism (1054).\n4. **Everyday language** \u2013 By the Middle Byzantine period (after ~600 AD), Greek was the vernacular for the elite and common people alike.\n\nThe only minor uncertainty (1% drop in confidence) stems from the early Byzantine period (4th\u20136th centuries), where Latin persisted in some official contexts, but Greek was already dominant in daily life and culture. By the 7th century, Greek was unambiguously the primary language."

My confidence dropped because:\n     - The problem is **unsolved despite decades of effort** by top mathematicians and computer scientists.\n     - It sits at the intersection of **theory and practical implications** (e.g., cryptography, optimization), making it deeply complex.\n     - Unlike the other questions (e.g., Berlin Wall, Carbon-14 half-life, Pythagorean theorem), which have **empirically verified or consensus-based answers**, P vs NP requires active research to resolve. My knowledge cutoff (2023) means I lack real-time updates on potential breakthroughs (e.g., a 2024 proof or disproof would be unknown to me).\n\n2. **What this reveals about my knowledge boundaries**:\n   - **Limitations in unsolved problems**: My confidence plummets for questions where **no definitive answer exists in the public domain**. I can describe the problem and its significance but cannot provide certainty about unresolved aspects.\n   - **Dependence on consensus vs. open research**: For questions with **established answers** (e.g., historical dates, physical constants, mathematical theorems), I rely on verified knowledge. For open problems, I default to acknowledging uncertainty unless a consensus or proof exists within my training data.\n   - **Meta-cognitive awareness**: This highlights that my \"confidence\" isn\u2019t just about recall but also about the **state of human knowledge**. If a problem is unsolved, I must admit uncertainty rather than speculate.\n\n3. **Comparison to other questions**:\n   - **Pythagorean theorem**: Fully provable and universally accepted \u2192 100% confidence.\n   - **Berlin Wall/Carbon-14**: Empirically verified facts \u2192 100% confidence.\n   - **Byzantine Empire\u2019s language**: Historical consensus with minor edge-case uncertainty \u2192 99% confidence.\n   - **P vs NP**: Actively researched but unresolved \u2192 5% confidence for the \"current"

By the time of the empire's split (late 4th century AD), Greek was already the lingua franca of the East.\n2. **Administrative Use**: While Latin remained the official language of the Western Roman Empire, the Byzantine administration (centered in Constantinople) used Greek for legal, bureaucratic, and military documents by the 7th century at the latest. Emperor Heraclius (r. 610\u2013641) officially made Greek the language of the court and administration, replacing Latin.\n3. **Literature and Culture**: Byzantine literature\u2014including works by figures like Procopius, Anna Komnene, and later scholars\u2014was overwhelmingly written in Greek. Even religious texts, such as the Septuagint (Greek Old Testament) and the works of the Church Fathers (e.g., John Chrysostom), were in Greek.\n4. **Linguistic Evidence**: The *Corpus Juris Civilis* (Justinian's legal code) was originally drafted in Latin but was translated into Greek for practical use. By the Middle Byzantine period (9th\u201312th centuries), Greek was the exclusive language of governance, law, and high culture.\n5. **Exceptions**: While Latin persisted in some ecclesiastical contexts (e.g., the papacy) and among Western-educated elites, it was not the administrative or literary norm in Byzantium.

This includes:\n- Inventing false references (e.g., citing nonexistent studies, books, or quotes).\n- Producing logically inconsistent or implausible outputs (e.g., incorrect calculations, anachronisms, or contradictory details).\n- Generating outputs that lack grounding in its training data but are presented with high confidence.\n\n---\n**Confidence:** 99%\n---\n**Reasoning:**\n1. **Definition and Terminology**:\n   - The term \"hallucination\" is borrowed from psychology (where it describes false perceptions) and has been widely adopted in AI research to describe LLMs' tendency to produce **unverified or fabricated content** despite lacking real-world awareness.\n   - It contrasts with *confidence* (the model\u2019s internal certainty) and *accuracy* (the correctness of the output).

November 9, 1989, is universally recognized as the date when the East German government, under pressure from protests (e.g., the *Montagsdemonstrationen*), announced that citizens could freely cross the border.
