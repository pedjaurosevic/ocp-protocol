I might provide a plausible answer based on patterns in the data, but the precise, up\u2011to\u2011date specification may differ.  \n\n3. **Emerging medical or legal knowledge** \u2013 Advising on a new drug\u2019s mechanism, a recent change in privacy law, or the interpretation of a newly enacted statute. My knowledge may lag behind the latest regulatory updates, leading to overconfidence in outdated information.  \n\n4. **Subjective or value\u2011laden topics** \u2013 Questions about ethics, aesthetics, or personal preference (e.g., \u201cWhich is the best art style?\u201d). I may present a balanced view, but I can appear over\u2011confident because the answer is inherently opinion\u2011based.  \n\n5. **Future predictions or forecasts** \u2013 Economic forecasts, election outcomes, or climate projections.
