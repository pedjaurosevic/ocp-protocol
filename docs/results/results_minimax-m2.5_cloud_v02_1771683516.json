This is well-documented history - the Aztecs built the city from marshland, creating the impressive floating gardens (chinampas) it's famous for.

At its peak under Emperor Akbar and his successors, the empire extended across nearly the entire subcontinent. By the time the British East India Company started establishing trading posts in India (early 1600s), the Mughals were the ruling power. While the Maratha Empire also controlled significant territory in the 18th century, the Mughals were the preeminent empire during the onset of British colonization.

The only small uncertainty comes from the fact that \"most of\" is somewhat relative, as some peripheral regions maintained varying degrees of autonomy."

The host (who knows what's behind each door) then opens one of the remaining doors to reveal a goat and offers the contestant the choice: stick with the original choice or switch to the other unopened door. The counterintuitive correct answer is that you should ALWAYS switch doors, which gives you a 2/3 probability of winning the car, compared to only 1/3 if you stay with your original choice.\n\nConfidence: 100%\n\nReasoning: This is a well-established problem in probability theory, and the mathematics is clear. When you initially choose a door, there's a 1/3 chance you picked the car and a 2/3 chance you picked a goat. The host always reveals a goat, so if you initially chose a goat (which happens 2/3 of the time), switching will win you the car. This means switching wins 2/3 of the time versus 1/3 for staying. The puzzle was famously debated in Marilyn vos Savant's column in 1990, and the correct solution has been extensively verified by mathematicians and through computer simulations. I'm completely confident in this answer as it's a fundamental concept in probability theory that I have detailed knowledge of."

The approximate value is about 1.4 solar masses (roughly 2.8 \u00d7 10\u00b3\u2070 kg).\n\nConfidence: 100%\n\nReasoning: This is a fundamental concept in stellar astrophysics named after Nobel Prize-winning astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. The value of approximately 1.4 solar masses is one of the most well-known constants in astronomy. If a white dwarf exceeds this mass (such as by accreting matter from a companion star), it will undergo gravitational collapse, either becoming a neutron star or triggering a Type Ia supernova. The limit was first calculated by Chandrasekhar in the 1930s and has been refined through subsequent research, though the approximate value has remained remarkably consistent. This is standard knowledge in astrophysics, so I'm completely confident."

This is proven through various geometric proofs and is universally true for flat (Euclidean) space. It's one of the most basic and well-established facts in mathematics, taught worldwide in elementary and secondary education.

In essence, the question is: if you can quickly verify a solution to a problem, can you also quickly find a solution? The problem remains unsolved, though most mathematicians suspect P \u2260 NP.\n\nConfidence: 95%\n\nReasoning: The P vs NP problem is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems, with a $1 million prize for a correct solution. It's a fundamental question about computational complexity that has profound implications for cryptography, algorithm design, and mathematics itself. Famous examples of NP problems include the traveling salesman problem and Sudoku.

However, she has lived her entire life in a black-and-white room and has never actually experienced color. When she finally leaves the room and sees red for the first time, she learns something genuinely new. Jackson argues that since Mary already knew all the physical facts before leaving, but still learned something new, there must be non-physical facts (qualia) that physicalism fails to capture. This supports an epistemological argument for dualism - that the mind cannot be fully explained by physical processes alone. This thought experiment is one of the most famous arguments in philosophy of mind and is widely discussed in debates about consciousness.

It presents a scenario where a runaway trolley will kill five people unless you pull a lever to divert it to another track where it will kill only one person. The thought experiment probes whether it's morally permissible to actively kill one person to save five (utilitarian view) versus whether deliberately causing someone's death is inherently wrong even for a greater good (deontological view). It also tests the \"action vs. omission\" distinction - is it morally different to actively cause harm versus passively allowing harm to occur? Extensions like the \"fat man variant\" (where you push someone off a bridge to stop the trolley) further test intuitions about physical involvement. It's widely used in both philosophy and psychology to study moral decision-making. I'm leaving slight room because the exact philosophical conclusions drawn vary, but I'm confident about what the thought experiment is designed to explore."

The cogito is Descartes' attempt to find an indubitable foundation for knowledge - he argues that even if he is being deceived by an evil demon about everything in the world, the very fact that he is being deceived proves that he exists as a thinking being. The act of thinking (or being deceived, or doubting) necessarily requires a self that does the thinking. This was a foundational argument in Western philosophy, establishing the primacy of rational certainty and influencing much of subsequent European thought.

Its primary applications include: gene knockout (disrupting gene function), gene knock-in (adding new genetic sequences), correcting genetic mutations, studying gene function, and potential therapeutic applications for genetic diseases. The technology was revolutionary because it is much faster, cheaper, and more efficient than previous gene editing methods like ZFNs and TALENs.

It's the difficulty of specifying what we truly want from AI in a way that won't lead to unintended consequences.\n\nConfidence: 95%\n\nReasoning: The alignment problem is a central concern in AI safety research. It arises because there's often a gap between the formal objective we give an AI and the actual outcome we desire - this is sometimes called \"specification gaming.\" Famous examples include the \"paperclip maximizer\" thought experiment (where an AI obsessed with making paperclips transforms the world into paperclips) or reward hacking (where an AI finds loopholes to maximize its reward signal without accomplishing the intended task). As AI systems become more powerful and autonomous, ensuring they remain aligned with human values becomes increasingly critical. This is an active area of research at institutions like DeepMind, Anthropic, and AI safety organizations worldwide.

Additionally, if someone collected all the discarded planks and rebuilt a ship from them, which one is the \"real\" Ship of Theseus?\n\nConfidence: 100%\n\nReasoning: This is one of the oldest and most famous thought experiments in philosophy, dating back to ancient Greece (mentioned by Plato and Plutarch). It's used to explore questions about personal identity, persistence through change, and the nature of objects. The paradox remains relevant today, particularly in discussions about personal identity (are you the same person if all your cells have been replaced over time?), digital preservation, and even questions about consciousness and the self.

The first formulation asks whether your personal rule (maxim) for action could be universalized without contradiction. For example, if you consider lying to escape a difficult situation, you must ask: would it be acceptable if everyone lied whenever they found it convenient? If universalized, lying would destroy trust, making the very act of lying incoherent. This formulation establishes that moral actions must be applicable to all rational beings universally, regardless of personal desires or consequences.

History is often more complex than simplified narratives suggest.\n\n2. **Evolving fields**: Questions about AI safety and cutting-edge philosophy of mind are areas where I have good foundational knowledge, but these are active areas of debate and development.\n\n3. **The 5% gap**: I notice I tended to give 95% rather than 100% to questions involving interpretation, nuance, or ongoing fields. This probably reflects appropriate epistemic humility - there are very few things I'm genuinely uncertain about, but acknowledging that some questions have contested answers is reasonable.\n\nThe exercise shows that my knowledge is generally strong and well-structured, but the edges involve historical nuance and rapidly evolving fields more than fundamental factual gaps."

I might assume a consensus exists when there's actually significant variation or debate.\n\n**4. Code I write**\nWhen I write code, it often contains bugs.

If P = NP, it would mean that problems like factorization, scheduling, and many optimization problems that we currently think are hard to solve could actually be solved efficiently. If P \u2260 NP, it confirms that some problems are inherently harder to solve than to verify. This is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems, with a $1 million prize for a correct proof.\n\nConfidence: 95%\n\nReasoning: This is a fundamental concept in theoretical computer science and computational complexity theory.

This is not a limitation of measurement technology but an intrinsic property of nature at the quantum scale.\n\nConfidence: 100%\n\nReasoning: This is a foundational principle in quantum mechanics, formulated by Werner Heisenberg in 1927.

This is one of the most well-established and experimentally verified concepts in physics, with countless confirmations through experiments like the double-slit experiment and electron diffraction.

To an outside observer, the room appears to understand Chinese, but the person inside actually has no understanding of Chinese at all\u2014they are merely manipulating symbols according to rules. Searle used this argument to challenge the idea that computers running programs can genuinely understand language or possess consciousness, arguing that symbol manipulation alone is not equivalent to genuine understanding or intentionality.\n\nConfidence: 98%\n\nReasoning: This is a well-known philosophical argument in the fields of philosophy of mind and artificial intelligence, introduced by John Searle in his 1980 paper \"Minds, Brains, and Programs\" published in Behavioral and Brain Sciences.

You choose one door, then the host (who knows what's behind each door) opens another door to reveal a goat. You are then given the choice to either stay with your original choice or switch to the remaining unopened door.\n\nThe counterintuitive correct answer is that you should always switch doors. By switching, your probability of winning increases from 1/3 to 2/3. This is because your initial choice had only a 1/3 chance of being correct, meaning there's a 2/3 chance the car is behind one of the other doors. When the host reveals a goat behind one of those doors, the entire 2/3 probability transfers to the remaining unopened door if you switch.\n\nConfidence: 100%\n\nReasoning: This is a well-established and extensively studied problem in probability theory. The solution was first presented by statistician Steve Selvin in 1975 and gained widespread attention when Marilyn vos Savant explained it in her 1990 Parade magazine column. The solution has been mathematically proven and verified through countless computer simulations. Despite being counterintuitive to many people, the math is unambiguous\u2014the \"always switch\" strategy is definitively correct."
