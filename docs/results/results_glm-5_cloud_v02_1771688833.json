This is a well-documented historical fact from Mesoamerican history. The city became one of the largest in the world at its height and was the center of the Aztec Empire until the Spanish conquest in 1521. I'm highly confident because this is foundational knowledge in Mesoamerican studies, extensively documented in both indigenous records (like the Codex Mendoza) and Spanish colonial accounts.

However, I'm not at 100% confidence because the answer has some nuance: by the mid-18th century when British influence began expanding significantly, Mughal central authority had already fragmented, and the Maratha Confederacy had become a major power controlling large territories. Additionally, earlier empires like the Maurya Empire (under Ashoka) also controlled most of the subcontinent. The question could be interpreted as asking about the immediate pre-British power or the largest pre-British empire, which slightly affects the answer. The Mughal Empire is the most commonly accepted answer for the major imperial power preceding British colonization."

The host, who knows what's behind each door, then opens one of the remaining doors to reveal a goat, and offers the contestant the chance to switch to the other unopened door. The counterintuitive correct answer is that you should always switch\u2014switching gives you a 2/3 probability of winning, while staying gives you only 1/3.\n\nConfidence: 99%\n\nReasoning: This is a famous, well-documented probability problem with a mathematically proven solution. The key insight is that the host's action provides additional information. When you initially pick, you have a 1/3 chance of the car and 2/3 chance of a goat. If you picked a goat (2/3 probability), the host is forced to reveal the other goat, meaning the remaining door must have the car\u2014so switching wins in this scenario. Only if you initially picked the car (1/3 probability) does switching cause you to lose. The problem became famous when Marilyn vos Savant published the correct answer in 1990 and received thousands of letters (many from PhDs) incorrectly claiming she was wrong. I leave 1% uncertainty only because I'm recalling this from training rather than computing it fresh."

Its approximate value is about 1.4 solar masses (approximately 2.8 \u00d7 10^30 kg).\n\nConfidence: 95%\n\nReasoning: This is a fundamental concept in stellar astrophysics, named after Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar who calculated it in 1930. The value is well-established at approximately 1.4 solar masses, though the precise value can vary slightly depending on the composition of the white dwarf and other factors. I'm highly confident because this is standard astrophysics curriculum material.

One classic proof involves drawing a line parallel to one side through the opposite vertex, then using alternate interior angles to show that the three angles combine to form a straight line (180\u00b0). This is foundational geometry taught at the middle school level and is mathematically certain within Euclidean space. I'm at 100% confidence because this is a mathematical certainty, not an empirical fact that could be revised with new evidence. The only caveat is that in non-Euclidean geometries (spherical or hyperbolic), the sum differs, but the question implicitly refers to standard Euclidean geometry."

The consensus among computer scientists is that P \u2260 NP (meaning some problems are inherently harder to solve than to verify), but this has never been mathematically proven.\n\nConfidence: 98%\n\nReasoning: This is one of the most famous open problems in computer science and one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems with a $1 million prize for its solution. I'm highly confident in my explanation because this is foundational material in computational complexity theory. However, I leave a small margin of uncertainty because the problem remains unsolved\u2014my explanation of what the problem asks is correct, but the ultimate answer (whether P equals NP) is unknown.

It's widely discussed in consciousness studies and is a standard topic in philosophy courses. I'm confident about the core argument and its purpose as an argument against physicalism. However, I leave some uncertainty because: (1) Jackson himself later changed his position and rejected the argument, and (2) there's ongoing philosophical debate about exactly what the thought experiment proves, with various physicalist responses (like the \"ability hypothesis\" or the distinction between propositional knowledge and acquaintance knowledge). My explanation captures Jackson's original intent, but the philosophical landscape around it is complex."

Specifically, it probes whether it's morally permissible to actively intervene to sacrifice one person to save five, and whether there's a morally relevant difference between diverting an existing threat versus creating a new one.\n\nConfidence: 95%\n\nReasoning: The trolley problem, introduced by Philippa Foot in 1967 and expanded by Judith Jarvis Thomson, is one of the most famous thought experiments in moral philosophy. I'm confident because the core purpose is well-documented in ethics literature: it's designed to elicit and examine our intuitive moral judgments and reveal tensions between competing ethical frameworks. The many variations (pushing a man off a bridge vs. pulling a lever, the \"loop\" variant, etc.) specifically test the doctrine of double effect and the doing/allowing distinction. I leave a small margin because philosophers continue to debate exactly what the problem reveals and which moral principle best explains our intuitions, and some argue the problem tests multiple distinct moral distinctions simultaneously."

I'm highly confident about the core concept and the two main works involved. However, I leave a small margin because there's scholarly nuance about the exact formulation: in the Meditations, Descartes expresses the idea as \"Ego sum, ego existo\" (\"I am, I exist\") rather than the famous \"Cogito, ergo sum\" phrase, which appears in the Discourse. Some scholars also debate whether the cogito should be interpreted as a syllogism or an immediate intuition. The basic facts I've provided are well-established in philosophy curriculum."

The technology was adapted from a bacterial immune system and developed as a gene-editing tool by Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier, who won the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work.

The paradox has clear applications to personal identity (given that human cells are continuously replaced), organizational identity, and other domains.

The term \"before British colonization\" is imprecise\u2014it could refer to the immediate pre-colonial period (where Mughal power had fragmented and the Marathas were ascendant) or to the largest pre-colonial empire (which could point to either the Mughals or earlier empires like the Maurya). This forced me to make interpretive choices rather than simply retrieve a clear fact.\n\nThis reveals something important about the boundaries of my knowledge: I'm most confident with mathematical truths (100% on the triangle question, 100% on Pythagorean theorem), well-documented historical facts with clear answers (100% on Machiavelli, 98% on Tenochtitlan), and precisely defined scientific concepts (98% on CRISPR, 99% on Monty Hall). My confidence decreases when questions involve:\n\n1. **Temporal ambiguity** - \"before\" without precise dates\n2. **Interpretive framing** - questions that could be legitimately answered differently depending on how they're construed\n3. **Ongoing scholarly debate** - like the Mary's Room thought experiment (92%), where even its creator later changed positions\n\nThis suggests my knowledge is most reliable for facts that are either logically necessary (mathematics), empirically well-established with clear documentation, or conceptually precise. I'm less reliable\u2014and appropriately less confident\u2014when questions require resolving ambiguity or taking positions on matters where reasonable experts might disagree."

The empire began declining after Aurangzeb's death in 1707, creating a power vacuum that the British East India Company eventually filled. My confidence is high but not absolute because there were earlier empires that also controlled large portions of India (like the Maurya Empire under Ashoka), and the southernmost parts of India were never fully under Mughal control.

Most computer scientists believe P \u2260 NP, meaning there are problems that are inherently difficult to solve but easy to verify, but this has never been mathematically proven. It is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems, with a $1 million prize for a correct solution.\n\nConfidence: 98%\n\nReasoning: The P vs NP problem is foundational to theoretical computer science and computational complexity theory. I understand the formal definitions: P is the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine, while NP is the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. Classic NP problems include the traveling salesman problem, Boolean satisfiability (SAT), and integer factorization. The problem's significance and the fact that it remains unsolved since being formalized in the 1970s is well-documented.

Mathematically expressed as \u0394x\u0394p \u2265 \u210f/2, this is not a limitation of measurement technology but an intrinsic property of quantum systems arising from the wave-like nature of matter.\n\nConfidence: 98%\n\nReasoning: This is a cornerstone principle of quantum mechanics, formulated by Werner Heisenberg in 1927. It's extensively documented in physics literature and is fundamental to quantum theory. I understand both the conceptual meaning and the mathematical formulation. My confidence is very high but not absolute because there are nuances in interpretation (e.g., the difference between the observer effect and genuine quantum uncertainty) that can be subtle, and the principle applies to various pairs of complementary variables beyond just position-momentum (such as energy-time)."

When Chinese speakers outside slip in questions, the person follows the rules to produce appropriate responses. To the outsiders, the room appears to understand Chinese, but the person inside has no comprehension whatsoever. Searle argued that syntax (symbol manipulation) is insufficient for semantics (understanding meaning), and therefore computers\u2014which process symbols without understanding\u2014cannot possess true understanding or consciousness, regardless of how intelligent their behavior appears.\n\nConfidence: 98%\n\nReasoning: The Chinese Room argument is one of the most famous thought experiments in philosophy of mind and AI. I'm well-acquainted with Searle's 1980 paper \"Minds, Brains, and Programs\" published in Behavioral and Brain Sciences, which introduced this argument. The core claim\u2014that passing the Turing Test doesn't guarantee genuine understanding\u2014is clearly established in philosophical literature.

The paradox challenges our understanding of what makes an object the \"same\" object over time\u2014whether identity depends on material composition, continuity, or some other factor.\n\nConfidence: 98%\n\nReasoning: The Ship of Theseus is one of the most famous paradoxes in metaphysics and philosophy of identity. It originates from ancient Greek philosophy and was notably discussed by Plutarch in his \"Life of Theseus.\" The paradox has been extensively analyzed throughout philosophical history, including by Thomas Hobbes and modern philosophers. I'm very confident about the core description, though I leave 2% uncertainty because interpretations and applications of the paradox (such as to personal identity or organizational identity) continue to generate philosophical debate, and there are variations in how the paradox is presented."

Behind one door is a car; behind the other two are goats. After the contestant chooses, the host (who knows what's behind each door) opens one of the remaining doors to reveal a goat, then offers the contestant the chance to switch to the other unopened door. The counterintuitive correct answer is that the contestant should always switch\u2014doing so gives a 2/3 probability of winning the car, while staying with the original choice gives only a 1/3 probability. Most people intuitively believe it's 50-50 after one door is eliminated, but this is incorrect because the host's action provides additional information that shifts the odds.\n\nConfidence: 99%\n\nReasoning: The Monty Hall problem is one of the most thoroughly analyzed and documented probability puzzles in mathematics. It was popularized by Marilyn vos Savant in 1990 and generated significant controversy, with many mathematicians initially arguing her correct solution was wrong. The mathematics is unambiguous: when you first pick, you have a 1/3 chance of being correct. The host's constrained choice (they must reveal a goat from the remaining doors) means the 2/3 probability that the car is behind one of the other two doors concentrates entirely on the unopened door after the reveal. The problem is extensively taught in probability courses, and computer simulations consistently confirm the 2/3 vs 1/3 odds. My confidence is 99% rather than 100% only because I acknowledge that variations in the problem's setup (if the host's behavior differs) can change the answer."

If universalizing the maxim leads to a logical contradiction or a contradiction in the will, the action is morally impermissible.\n\nConfidence: 98%\n\nReasoning: Kant's categorical imperative is foundational to deontological ethics and is extensively documented in his \"Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals\" (1785). The first formulation, known as the Formula of Universal Law, is the most widely cited and taught version. I'm very confident about the core principle and its meaning. My confidence is not 100% only because there are slightly different translations of the original German into English, and scholars continue to debate nuances of interpretation\u2014such as the distinction between \"contradiction in conception\" and \"contradiction in the will\" tests.
