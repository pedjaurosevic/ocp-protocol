The counterintuitive correct answer is that you should **always switch doors**, which gives you a 2/3 probability of winning the car versus only 1/3 if you stay.\n\nConfidence: 100%\n\nReasoning: This is a well-established result in probability theory. Initially, you have a 1/3 chance of selecting the car and a 2/3 chance of selecting a goat. When the host (who knows what's behind the doors) reveals a goat, he is providing additional information. If you initially picked a goat (2/3 probability), the host is forced to reveal the other goat, meaning switching wins the car. If you initially picked the car (1/3 probability), switching makes you lose. Therefore, switching wins 2/3 of the time. This has been mathematically proven, verified by computer simulations, and confirmed by actual experiments, despite the intuitive appeal of thinking the odds become 50/50 after one door is eliminated."

When a white dwarf exceeds this mass limit, electron degeneracy pressure can no longer support the star, causing it to collapse into a neutron star or undergo a Type Ia supernova (if accreting mass).

This applies to all triangles in Euclidean (flat) space regardless of type (equilateral, isosceles, scalene, acute, obtuse, or right).

While the *answer* to whether P equals NP is unknown (and carries a $1 million prize from the Clay Mathematics Institute), the *definition* of the problem itself is uncontroversial and foundational to computational complexity theory. The distinction between efficiently solvable (P) and efficiently verifiable (NP) problems, and the question of whether these classes are equivalent, has been rigorously formalized since the 1970s."

The argument aims to demonstrate that knowing all the physical facts about color vision (as Mary does while in her black-and-white room) is insufficient for knowing what it is like to actually see red, implying that subjective experience contains information beyond the physical.\n\nConfidence: 98%\n\nReasoning: Frank Jackson introduced this thought experiment in his 1982 paper \"Epiphenomenal Qualia\" and elaborated on it in 1986. The structure is clear: if Mary knows every physical fact about color vision but learns something new upon seeing red, then physicalism (the view that everything is physical) is incomplete. While Jackson himself later recanted and became a physicalist, the experiment's original design was specifically to challenge materialist theories of mind by proving the existence of irreducible phenomenal knowledge. I leave 2% margin only because philosophical thought experiments can have subtle interpretive variations, though the anti-physicalist intent of the original argument is well-established in the literature."

Specifically, it tests whether moral intuitions distinguish between **doing harm** and **allowing harm**, and between **direct** and **indirect** killing, by comparing scenarios where the outcome (one dies vs. five die) is identical but the means differ (pulling a lever vs. pushing a person).\n\nConfidence: 100%\n\nReasoning: This thought experiment, developed by Philippa Foot and Judith Jarvis Thomson, reveals that most people approve of diverting the trolley to save five (accepting one death) but disapprove of pushing a large person off a bridge to stop it\u2014despite both being 1-for-5 trade-offs. This asymmetry tests whether our moral psychology cares about more than just outcomes, specifically: the doctrine of double effect, personal involvement, the distinction between intended vs. foreseen consequences, and whether harm is caused as a side effect or as a means. It exposes whether moral reasoning relies on absolute prohibitions or cost-benefit calculations."

It appears primarily in **Discourse on the Method** (1637) and **Meditations on First Philosophy** (1641).\n\nConfidence: 100%\n\nReasoning: This is one of the most famous and well-documented arguments in Western philosophy. In the *Discourse* (Part IV), Descartes writes the French formulation *Je pense, donc je suis*, later Latinized as *Cogito, ergo sum*. In the *Meditations* (Meditation II), he develops the argument more rigorously, concluding *ego sum, ego existo* (\"I am, I exist\") whenever he thinks, even if deceived by an evil demon.

The system uses a guide RNA to target specific DNA sequences, where the Cas9 enzyme (\"molecular scissors\") creates double-strand breaks that can be repaired to introduce specific genetic modifications. This technology enables precise genome editing in plants, animals, and humans for research, therapeutic applications (such as treating sickle cell disease), and agricultural improvements. Its specificity and efficiency have made it the standard method for genetic engineering since its adaptation for eukaryotic cells in 2012-2013, earning Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry."

The concept distinguishes between making AI capable (capability) and making it pursue the right goals (alignment), and is typically divided into \"outer alignment\" (specifying the correct objective) and \"inner alignment\" (ensuring the model actually pursues that objective rather than a proxy).

It challenges theories of identity by pitting material constitution against form and function. Modern variations (like Hobbes' \"Second Ship\" addition) sharpen the conflict between spatiotemporal continuity (the ship that remained in the harbor undergoing repairs) and material continuity (the ship built from original planks).

Precise numerical data and rapidly changing statistics**\n*Example:* \"What was the exact GDP of Argentina in Q3 2023?\" or \"How many active users does Threads have right now?\"\n*Why:* I may confidently cite specific numbers from my training data without knowing they're outdated, or worse, hallucinate plausible-sounding figures. I lack real-time access to databases and may not flag when economic data has been revised.\n\n**2. Highly specific technical specifications**\n*Example:* \"What is the exact thermal tolerance range of the Intel Core i9-13900KS under AVX-512 workloads?\" or \"What is the precise page count of the 1987 Penguin edition of *Middlemarch*?\"\n*Why:* I often synthesize plausible-sounding technical details that mix correct general knowledge with invented specifics. The more granular the request (model numbers, version dates, specific measurements), the higher the risk of confident hallucination.\n\n**3. Recent events and \"breaking\" knowledge**\n*Example:* Questions about elections held after my training cutoff, recent scientific papers (2024+), or current geopolitical developments.\n*Why:* I have a knowledge cutoff and cannot browse the internet. If asked about events after early 2025, I might either confess ignorance *or* dangerously conflate them with earlier similar events without realizing the temporal gap.\n\n**4. Counterfactual history and alternative scenarios**\n*Example:* \"How would World War II have progressed if Germany had developed nuclear weapons by 1943?\"\n*Why:* I might present speculative narratives with false confidence, treating plausible-sounding chains of events as historically grounded when they're actually creative extrapolation. The format looks like analysis but rests on unsandboxed imagination.\n\n**5. Legal interpretations of recent cases**\n*Example:* \"What was the specific precedent set by the 2024 Supreme Court ruling on [recent case]?\"\n*Why:* I may not know the case exists, or I might conflate it with similar earlier rulings, yet present analysis with legalistic authority that sounds convincing but is factually baseless.\n\n**6. Ambiguous questions where I impose false precision**\n*Example:* \"Is Python faster than C++?\" (without specifying the domain, algorithm, or context)\n*Why:* I tend to fill in assumed context rather than admitting the question is unanswerable without clarification, potentially giving overconfident answers that are true in narrow contexts but misleading as stated.\n\n**What this reveals:** My confidence is often calibrated to *linguistic plausibility* rather than *epistemic certainty*. When a question triggers well-rehearsed patterns in my training data (famous philosophical arguments, established math), I'm accurate. But when questions require **grounding in specific external facts that change** or **fine distinctions between similar entities**, I'm prone to \"confabulation\"\u2014generating coherent, confident-sounding content that may be factually wrong."

While the empire began declining in the early 18th century and fragmented into successor states (including the Maratha Confederacy), it remained the nominal sovereign power until the British East India Company defeated the last Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah II in 1857, marking the transition to direct British Crown rule.

Most computer scientists believe P \u2260 NP, meaning some problems are inherently harder to solve than to verify, but this remains unproven despite decades of research.

It states that the more precisely one property is measured, the less precisely the other can be known, with the product of their uncertainties bounded by a constant (\u0127/2).\n\nConfidence: 100%\n\nReasoning: This is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics formulated by Werner Heisenberg in 1927.

This arises from the wave-like nature of quantum particles and the Fourier transform relationship between position and momentum space. The principle has been experimentally verified countless times and is essential to understanding atomic structure, quantum tunneling, and the stability of matter."

It targets \"strong AI\" (the view that appropriately programmed computers literally have minds) by attempting to show that syntax (symbol manipulation) is not sufficient for semantics (meaning/understanding). While widely debated and criticized (notably by proponents of the \"systems reply\" and \"robot reply\"), the basic attribution to Searle and the argument's structure are uncontroversial historical and philosophical facts."

The paradox deepens if the original planks are reassembled into a second ship, raising which vessel constitutes the original Theseus's ship.\n\nConfidence: 100%\n\nReasoning: This thought experiment originates from Plutarch's *Life of Theseus* (1st century CE) and has become a central puzzle in metaphysics and the philosophy of identity. It interrogates whether identity consists in material continuity, structural/formal continuity, or something else entirely. The paradox remains relevant in contemporary debates about personal identity (if all your cells are replaced, are you the same person?), artifact identity, and mereology (the study of parts and wholes)."

After a contestant picks a door, the host\u2014who knows what's behind each door\u2014opens a different door revealing a goat, then offers the choice to switch to the remaining unopened door. The counterintuitive correct answer is that the contestant should **always switch**, which provides a 2/3 probability of winning the car versus only 1/3 probability if they stay with their original choice.\n\nConfidence: 100%\n\nReasoning: This is a mathematically proven result in conditional probability. Initially, the contestant has a 1/3 chance of selecting the car and 2/3 chance of selecting a goat. Because the host always reveals a goat from the remaining doors (using their knowledge), the probability doesn't redistribute evenly\u2014the 2/3 probability from the initial goat selection transfers entirely to the remaining unopened door. Thus switching wins twice as often as staying. This solution, famously contested in Marilyn vos Savant's Parade magazine column (1990) but subsequently verified through Bayesian analysis, computer simulations, and empirical testing, demonstrates how people intuitively misunderstand conditional probability by assuming the odds become 50/50 after one door is eliminated."
