The argument claims this \u201cwhat-it-is-like\u201d knowledge is not captured by physical science, implying qualia are irreducible.

Philosophers use it to probe whether people judge the permissibility of an act by its consequences or by the nature of the act itself. The remaining 2 % uncertainty acknowledges that the problem can also be framed to explore related issues like moral luck, responsibility, or the doctrine of double effect, but its core purpose is the utilitarian vs. deontological clash."
