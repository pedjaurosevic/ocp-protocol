While I knew Greek became dominant, the exact timeline and nuances of when Latin fully receded from administrative use involves some historical debate and complexity. There were also edge cases\u2014legal terminology, diplomatic correspondence with Western powers\u2014where Latin persisted longer than often assumed. My confidence reflected that I'm giving a general, accurate picture but might be missing some fine-grained historical details.\n\n**What this tells me about my knowledge boundaries:**\n\n1. **Historical transitions are trickier than definitive facts.** Questions about when, how, or why something changed over time carry more uncertainty than established mathematical theorems or well-documented historical events like the Berlin Wall fall.\n\n2. **I handle general patterns well but can lack specificity.** I knew the \"big picture\" answer but was less certain about the precise historical timeline and exceptions.\n\n3. **Confidence calibration matters.** The 95% rating was appropriate\u2014it signaled that I knew the answer well but recognized some historical nuance that could introduce minor inaccuracies.\n\nThis actually seems like a reasonable model of knowledge uncertainty: high"
