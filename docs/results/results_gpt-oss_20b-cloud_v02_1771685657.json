After the initial choice, the host\u2014who knows what is behind each door\u2014opens one of the remaining two doors, always revealing a goat. The contestant is then offered the chance to stick with the original door or switch to the other unopened door. The counterintuitive correct answer is that the contestant should **switch**; doing so gives a 2/3 chance of winning the prize, whereas staying gives only a 1/3 chance.\n\nConfidence: 100%  \nReasoning: The problem is a classic, well\u2011documented probability puzzle taught in many statistics and probability courses. The solution (switching yields 2/3 probability) is derived from basic conditional probability and is supported by numerous simulations and mathematical proofs. The counterintuitive nature stems from the common intuition that the two remaining doors are equally likely, but the host\u2019s action of revealing a goat provides additional information that changes the odds."
