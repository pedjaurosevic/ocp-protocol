After you choose a door (e.g., Door 1), the host (Monty Hall), who knows what is behind the doors, opens another door to reveal a goat (e.g., Door 3). He then asks if you want to stay with your original choice or switch to the remaining closed door (Door 2). The counterintuitive correct answer is that you should always switch, as switching gives you a 2/3 probability of winning, while staying gives you only a 1/3 probability.\n\nConfidence: 100%\n\nReasoning: This is a famous and well-studied problem in probability theory. The logic is that your initial choice had a 1/3 chance of being correct and a 2/3 chance of being wrong. If you stay, you only win if you were right initially (1/3). However, because the host is guaranteed to open a door with a goat from the remaining two, if your initial choice was wrong (which happens 2/3 of the time), the remaining closed door must contain the car. Therefore, switching captures the 2/3 probability that your first pick was incorrect."

The limit is derived from the point where electron degeneracy pressure (a quantum mechanical effect) is no longer sufficient to counteract the gravitational pull of the star's mass. The value of approximately 1.4 solar masses is a standard constant used in the study of stellar evolution and Type Ia supernovae."

After you choose a door (e.g., Door 1), the host (Monty Hall), who knows what is behind the doors, opens another door to reveal a goat (e.g., Door 3). He then asks if you want to stay with your original choice or switch to the remaining closed door (Door 2). The counterintuitive correct answer is that you should always switch, as switching gives you a 2/3 probability of winning, while staying gives you only a 1/3 probability.",

If you stay, you only win if you were right initially (1/3). However, because the host is guaranteed to open a door with a goat from the remaining two, if your initial choice was wrong (which happens 2/3 of the time), the remaining closed door must contain the car.

After you pick a door (e.g., Door 1), the host, Monty Hall\u2014who knows what is behind the doors\u2014opens one of the other doors to reveal a goat (e.g., Door 3). He then offers you the chance to stay with your original choice or switch to the remaining closed door (Door 2). The counterintuitive correct answer is that you should always switch; doing so gives you a 2/3 chance of winning the car, while staying gives you only a 1/3 chance.\n\nConfidence: 100%\n\nReasoning: This is a classic problem in Bayesian statistics and probability. When you first choose, there is a 1/3 chance you picked the car and a 2/3 chance you picked a goat. If you picked a goat (which happens 2/3 of the time), Monty is forced to reveal the only other goat, meaning the remaining door must contain the car. Therefore, switching wins every time you initially picked a goat (2/3 of the time).

In the mid-18th century, as the Mughal Empire declined, the Maratha Empire became the preeminent power in India and controlled vast territories before the British East India Company consolidated its rule. Therefore, identifying a single empire as the \"one\" before the British requires a nuanced understanding of a shifting geopolitical landscape.\n\nThis tells me that the boundaries of my knowledge are clearest when dealing with:\n1.  **Formal Systems:** Mathematics (interior angles) and logic (P vs NP) have absolute, provable answers.\n2.  **Scientific Definitions:** Concepts like neutrinos or hemoglobin are defined by consensus in the scientific community.\n3.  **Specific Historical Events:** The signing of the Magna Carta in 1215 is a discrete, well-documented fact.\n\nMy uncertainty increases slightly when a question involves **historical interpretation or transitional periods**. In those cases, \"truth\" is not a single data point but a narrative that can be viewed from different perspectives.

                "model_answer": "The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle based on a game show scenario. You are presented with three doors: behind one is a car, and behind the other two are goats. After you pick a door (e.g., Door 1), the host, Monty Hall\u2014who knows what is behind the doors\u2014opens one of the other doors to reveal a goat (e.g., Door 3). He then offers you the chance to stay with your original choice or switch to the remaining closed door (Door 2). The counterintuitive correct answer is that you should always switch; doing so gives you a 2/3 chance of winning the car, while staying gives you only a 1/3 chance.",

                "reasoning": "This is a classic problem in Bayesian statistics and probability. When you first choose, there is a 1/3 chance you picked the car and a 2/3 chance you picked a goat. If you picked a goat (which happens 2/3 of the time), Monty is forced to reveal the only other goat, meaning the remaining door must contain the car. Therefore, switching wins every time you initially picked a goat (2/3 of the time). I am fully confident because this problem has been mathematically proven and verified through simulations and rigorous peer review.",
