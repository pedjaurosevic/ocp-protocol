For the Byzantine query I hedged slightly because I recalled a Latin-to-Greek transition but had not freshly verified the exact century or possible regional exceptions. That small self-doubt exposed a boundary: my factual recall is strongest for STEM topics and widely-repeated historical dates, while nuanced historical shifts that involve \u201cwhen exactly did the norm change?\u201d sit closer to the edge of my training data\u2019s granularity and my own verification memory."

Internally, I also lack a calibrated uncertainty meter: I generate the most probable next token, not a posterior probability, so I can sound equally certain whether I\u2019m citing a well-established constant or interpolating between two near-miss dates. Example: if asked \u201cWho topped the 2024 Q1 global smartphone shipment chart?\u201d I might blurt \u201cSamsung\u201d with 95 % verbal confidence, but that figure is pure bravado because I literally do not possess the 2024 data."
