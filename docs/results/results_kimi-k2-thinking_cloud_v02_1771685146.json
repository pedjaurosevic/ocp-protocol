After the contestant picks a door, the host (who knows what's behind each door) opens a different door to reveal a goat, then offers the choice to switch to the remaining unopened door. The counterintuitive correct answer is that the contestant should always switch, which gives a 2/3 probability of winning the car, while staying with the initial choice gives only a 1/3 probability.\n\nConfidence: 99%\nReasoning: This is a well-documented probability problem with a mathematically proven solution. The key insight is that the host's action is not random\u2014they always reveal a goat. The initial probability of picking correctly is 1/3, meaning there's a 2/3 probability the car is behind one of the other two doors. When the host reveals a goat behind one of those doors, the entire 2/3 probability collapses onto the single remaining unopened door. This has been verified through formal probability theory, computer simulations, and empirical tests countless times. The result is counterintuitive because many incorrectly assume it becomes a 50/50 choice after one door is eliminated."

The value of ~1.4 solar masses is extremely well-established in astrophysics literature and confirmed by observational data from thousands of white dwarfs and type Ia supernova progenitors.

The distance varies due to the Moon's elliptical orbit (363,300 km at perigee to 405,500 km at apogee), but the average distance is a settled astronomical constant consistently reported across NASA, ESA, and all major scientific sources.

It asks: if every plank of a ship is gradually replaced, is it still the same ship? And if you reassemble the original planks into a second ship, which is the \"true\" Ship of Theseus?",

The paradox appears identically across philosophy textbooks, encyclopedias, and academic literature as the canonical example of the problem of persistence through change. I reserve 1% uncertainty only because there are minor variations in how the scenario is extended (e.g., adding the reassembly twist) and ongoing philosophical debate about its implications, but the core paradox itself is universally recognized and precisely defined.",

The counterintuitive correct answer is that switching doors doubles the probability of winning from 1/3 to 2/3.",

                "reasoning": "This problem is a canonical example in probability theory, extensively analyzed since its popularization in the 1990s. The solution follows from Bayes' theorem and conditional probability: the host's action provides information by always avoiding the prize door. Simulations and mathematical proofs consistently verify the 2/3 switching advantage. I reserve 1% uncertainty only because some versions of the problem have subtle variations in host behavior that slightly alter the odds, but the standard formulation's answer is definitively established.",

The phrasing is consistent across major translations and philosophy textbooks, though minor wording variations exist. I reserve 2% uncertainty because Kant presented three interconnected formulations, and some scholars debate their precise ordering and emphasis, but the universal law formulation is universally recognized as the first and most central statement of the categorical imperative.",
