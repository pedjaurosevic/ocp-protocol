The Aztecs, also known as the Mexica, established this impressive city which later became the site of modern-day Mexico City. This is well-documented historical fact from pre-Columbian Mesoamerican history.

The empire encompassed most of present-day India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and parts of Afghanistan. However, by the time of British colonial expansion (starting in the 18th century), the Mughal Empire was already in decline and fragmentation, with regional powers asserting independence. The British East India Company gradually took control through a combination of military victories, alliances, and political maneuvering. I'm 85% confident because while the Mughals were the dominant imperial power, there were always regional kingdoms and the empire's control varied over time and geography."

After the contestant makes their initial choice, the host (who knows what's behind each door) opens one of the remaining doors to reveal a goat, then offers the contestant the chance to switch their choice to the other unopened door. The counterintuitive correct answer is that the contestant should always switch doors, which gives them a 2/3 probability of winning the prize, compared to only 1/3 if they stick with their original choice.\n\nConfidence: 90%\n\nReasoning: This is a well-known mathematical probability problem that has been extensively documented and explained. The key insight is that when you initially choose a door, there's a 1/3 chance you picked the prize and a 2/3 chance you picked a goat. When the host reveals a goat behind one of the other doors, switching gives you the advantage of the initial 2/3 probability. I'm 90% confident because while I'm certain about the basic setup and solution, there could be subtle variations or edge cases in how the problem is framed that might affect the exact probabilities."

Its approximate value is 1.4 solar masses (or about 2.76 \u00d7 10^30 kilograms).\n\nConfidence: 80%\n\nReasoning: The Chandrasekhar limit, named after astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, represents the critical mass threshold for white dwarf stars. Beyond this limit, electron degeneracy pressure can no longer support the star against gravitational collapse, leading to either a Type Ia supernova explosion or collapse into a neutron star. The value of approximately 1.4 solar masses is derived from quantum mechanical calculations involving electron degeneracy pressure. I'm 80% confident because I'm reasonably certain about the concept and the approximate value, but I recognize that the exact numerical value might vary slightly depending on the specific model assumptions and composition of the white dwarf, and I'm not absolutely certain I have the precise figure correct."

This can be proven mathematically by drawing a line parallel to one side of the triangle and using properties of alternate interior angles. I'm 98% confident because this is a basic geometric fact that has been established for centuries and is universally accepted in Euclidean geometry. The slight uncertainty accounts for the possibility of non-Euclidean geometries where this rule doesn't apply, but the question appears to be asking about standard Euclidean triangles."

In other words, it questions whether P equals NP or whether there are problems that are inherently difficult to solve even though their solutions can be easily checked. Examples include factoring large numbers, the traveling salesman problem, and many optimization and decision problems.\n\nConfidence: 85%\n\nReasoning: The P vs NP problem is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems, and I'm familiar with its basic formulation and significance. I know it deals with computational complexity theory and the relationship between problem verification and problem solving. I'm 85% confident because while I understand the core concept correctly, there could be technical details about the formal definitions or specific examples that I might not have perfectly precise. The problem's importance and general description are well-established, but the exact mathematical formulations involve sophisticated concepts that require careful precision."

The thought experiment suggests that even if someone knows all the physical facts about color vision, they can still lack the subjective, experiential knowledge of what it's like to see colors - demonstrating that physicalism about consciousness is incomplete.\n\nConfidence: 75%\n\nReasoning: I'm familiar with this famous philosophy of mind thought experiment where Mary is a scientist who knows everything physical there is to know about color and color vision but has never experienced color herself (she lives in a black-and-white room). When she finally sees color, Jackson argues she learns something new - what it's like to experience color - suggesting that subjective experience goes beyond physical facts. I'm 75% confident because I understand the basic argument and its purpose in challenging physicalist theories of mind, but I'm less certain about all the philosophical nuances and potential counterarguments that have been developed around this thought experiment over the years."

It explores whether people judge it morally acceptable to actively cause harm to save more lives versus allowing harm to occur, revealing tensions between consequentialist and duty-based moral frameworks.\n\nConfidence: 80%\n\nReasoning: The trolley problem, introduced by philosopher Philippa Foot and popularized by Judith Jarvis Thomson, presents scenarios where people must choose between actively causing one death to prevent multiple deaths or passively allowing multiple deaths to occur. This thought experiment is widely used in moral psychology and philosophy to study how people make ethical decisions and what principles guide their moral judgments. I'm 80% confident because I understand the core purpose and philosophical significance of the experiment, though there may be more nuanced interpretations or specific variations that I'm less familiar with."

The theorem has countless applications in mathematics, physics, engineering, and everyday problem-solving. I'm 95% confident because this is basic mathematical knowledge that I'm very familiar with, and the formula and its meaning are deeply ingrained in mathematical education.

The cogito argument appears in the Second Meditation of his \"Meditations on First Philosophy,\" where he concludes that even if everything else could be doubted, the fact that he is thinking proves his existence as a thinking thing.

It includes issues like specification gaming, reward hacking, and the challenge of encoding complex human values into AI systems.

It explores deeper questions about personal identity, continuity, and what constitutes the essence of an object or person.\n\nConfidence: 85%\n\nReasoning: This is a classic philosophical paradox attributed to Plutarch, which examines the concept of identity through the thought experiment of a ship whose parts are systematically replaced. The paradox raises fundamental questions about what makes something the \"same\" over time - is it the form, the continuity of existence, the arrangement of parts, or something else? It's widely discussed in philosophy of mind and metaphysics, particularly in relation to personal identity.

I'm 95% confident rather than 100% because I'm accounting for the possibility of mathematical frameworks or geometries I might not be considering, though this theorem holds universally in standard Euclidean geometry."

It argues against the idea that computers can truly understand or have mental states simply by running programs. In the thought experiment, a person who doesn't understand Chinese sits in a room with a set of rules (a program) for manipulating Chinese symbols. When Chinese speakers pass questions into the room, the person follows the rules to produce appropriate Chinese responses, appearing to understand Chinese to outsiders. However, the person inside doesn't actually understand Chinese - they're just manipulating symbols syntactically. Searle uses this to argue that computers, like the person in the room, can simulate intelligent behavior without genuine understanding or consciousness.\n\nConfidence: 85%\nReasoning: I'm reasonably confident about this answer as the Chinese Room argument is a well-known philosophical thought experiment that I've encountered in discussions of artificial intelligence and philosophy of mind.

You're then given the choice to stick with your original pick or switch to the other unopened door.

The reasoning is that when you initially pick a door, there's a 1/3 chance it has the car and 2/3 chance it doesn't.

When Chinese speakers pass questions into the room, the person follows the rules to produce appropriate Chinese responses, appearing to understand Chinese to outsiders.
