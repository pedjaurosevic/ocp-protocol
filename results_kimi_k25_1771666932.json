The theorem specifically concerns Diophantine equations of the form $a^n + b^n = c^n$, asserting that no solutions exist in positive integers when the exponent $n$ is greater than 2. This contrasts with the Pythagorean theorem (the case where $n=2$), which has infinitely many solutions.

Recent developments and rapidly changing facts**\n*Example:* \"What is the current status of the conflict in [active war zone]?\" or \"Who is the current CEO of [company that changed leadership last month]?\"\n\nMy training data has a cutoff, so I often don't know what happened in the last few months. Yet I might confidently synthesize outdated information or fail to flag that my knowledge is stale. I'm particularly dangerous here because I can sound authoritative about events that have since evolved dramatically.\n\n**2. Precise numerical thresholds and statistics**\n*Example:* \"What percentage of the Amazon rainforest was lost in 2022?\" or \"What is the exact failure rate of SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets?\"\n\nI often remember approximate ranges but confidently state specific percentages that may be slightly off. The numbers feel \"truthy\" because they fit the narrative, but I lack the ability to verify against primary databases. I'm likely overconfident when citing specific statistics.\n\n**3. Technical specifications and version-dependent software details**\n*Example:* \"In TensorFlow 2.14, what is the default behavior of the `tf.keras` optimizer when `clipnorm` is set to None?\"\n\nI know general principles, but specific version-dependent defaults, deprecated parameters, or recent API changes are high-risk zones. I might describe how something worked in version 2.8 while confidently asserting it's current.\n\n**4. Nuanced legal and medical distinctions**\n*Example:* \"Is ps"
