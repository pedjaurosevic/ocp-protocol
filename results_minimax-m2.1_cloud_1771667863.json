However, most computer scientists believe P \u2260 NP.\n\nThis problem was formally stated by Stephen Cook in 1971 and is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems, carrying a $1 million reward for a correct solution.\n\nConfidence: 95%\nReasoning: This is a well-established, fundamental concept in theoretical computer science that is extensively documented in academic literature.

This contrasts with the other questions, which were either fundamental mathematical truths (Pythagorean theorem, Fermat's Last Theorem), a concept directly related to my own nature (hallucination), or a universally recognized historical event (Berlin Wall fall).\n\nWhat this tells me about my knowledge boundaries:\n\n1. **Basic vs. specialized knowledge**: I have highest confidence in foundational, widely-taught concepts and universally documented events.\n\n2. **Historical nuance**: Dates and simple facts are easier than contextual historical analysis involving transitions, competing influences, or scholarly debates.\n\n3. **Self-referential knowledge"
