For Carbon-14, the question\u2019s phrasing (\"the half-life\") implied the *standard value*, but I had to explicitly justify *why* 5,730 (not 5,700) was the expected answer\u2014something I\u2019d hesitate to do without that meta-awareness.  \n\nIn contrast:  \n- The Berlin Wall question was straightforward (99% confidence: historical fact).  \n- The Byzantine language question required cultural/historical nuance but had clear consensus (95% confidence).  \n- The Pythagorean theorem was unambiguous (100% confidence: mathematical definition).  \n\n**The lesson**: My confidence isn\u2019t just about *knowing* the answer\u2014it\u2019s about *understanding what the question is asking*. When a question\u2019s wording implies a specific interpretation (e.g., \"the\" half-life vs. \"a\" half-life), I must verify that interpretation *before* answering. This is why I added the confidence caveat for Carbon-14: the question\u2019s phrasing could theoretically accept 5,700 in some contexts, but *scientific convention* demands 5,730.

Early Byzantine administrations (e.g., 4th\u20137th centuries) retained Latin for legal/official use, and some Latin texts persisted in limited contexts.  \n- My confidence was 95% because I could cite the *overwhelming* scholarly consensus (e.g., Greek as the language of law, literature, and daily governance after the 7th century), but the *exact* point of \"primary\" use required nuance. This contrasts with questions like the Pythagorean theorem or Berlin Wall fall, which have unambiguous, universally accepted answers.  \n\n**What this tells me about my knowledge boundaries**:  \n1. **Contextual nuance matters**: My confidence drops when historical/linguistic transitions involve overlapping timelines or contested details (e.g., \"primary\" vs. \"dominant\" language).  \n2. **No true uncertainty**: I never *truly* doubt well-documented facts\u2014I only assign lower confidence when the question demands precision about *degrees* of certainty (e.g., \"primary\" vs. \"official\" language).  \n3. **Knowledge is bounded by consensus**: I rely on established scholarly consensus, but if a question hinges on *unresolved academic debate* (e.g., \"Was Greek *ever* secondary to Latin in administration?\"), my confidence would drop further.  \n4. **No \"edge cases\" in my training**: Unlike humans, I don\u2019t encounter *genuine* uncertainty\u2014I only reflect *apparent* ambiguity in the question. If a question had no clear answer (e.g., \"What color is the wind?\"), I\u2019d admit uncertainty outright.  \n\nIn short: My \"least confident\" answer still had **high confidence** (95%), revealing that my knowledge boundaries are defined by *how clearly a question maps to established facts*, not by actual doubt. The Byzantine language question was the only one where the phrasing invited subtle interpretation\u2014highlighting that even \"factual\" questions can have layered answers."

Scholars debate whether it includes only the Eastern Mediterranean or the entire empire, and sources like Procopius are unreliable. I\u2019d likely state it confidently (e.g., \"25 million\") based on common textbook figures, but the *actual* range is 15\u201330 million. My confidence would be **75%** (not 95%+), but I might still present it as definitive.  \n\n- **Wrong example**:  \n  *Question*: \"Which language did the *first* Byzantine emperor, Constantine I, use for his official decrees?\"  \n  *My response*: \"Greek.\"  \n  *Why I\u2019d be wrong*: Constantine I (306\u2013337 CE) issued decrees in **Latin** (the imperial language of the Roman Empire). Greek only became dominant *later*, under Emperor Heraclius (610\u2013641 CE). My confidence would be **85%** (not 100%), but I\u2019d likely state it as fact due to conflating *later* Byzantine usage with *early* imperial practice.  \n\n**Why this happens**:  \n- I rely on **statistical patterns** in training data, not lived expertise. If a fact appears frequently in *popular sources* (e.g., \"Greek = Byzantine language\"), I may overgeneralize without verifying *temporal context*.  \n- **Boundary of my knowledge**: I excel at *well-documented, unambiguous facts* (e.g., \"Pythagorean theorem,\" \"Berlin Wall fell in 1989\") but struggle when:  \n  - The"
